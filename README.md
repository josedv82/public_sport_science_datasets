# Sport Science Public Datasets
An ongoing compilation of publicly available datasets for sport science projects.

### Motivation

The importance of data skills for sport scientists is not new. Regardless the level of experience, being able to showcase skills in this area will help in various ways, such as future job interviews, networking or help create opportunities to collaborate with others in the field.  

Although there are more sport analytics courses and learning materials available nowadays, a comment that I usually get when it comes to learning data skills is that the datasets used during early learning stages are not motivating and not sport specific.

Unfortunately, sport scientists may not always have access to the type of data that is usually available to professional teams and sport organizations however, there are more and more publicly available datasets that can be used to develop and show your data skills, analytical process and creativity when it comes to sport science analysis. 

This resource aims to provide a list of some of those publicly available datasets that can hopefully be used to create sport science data projects and the goal is to continue adding more over time. 

See below for a list of currently featured datasets:

### How to contribute
Contributions to help grow this resource are more than welcome so others can benefit. Every contributors will be visible on this page.

**Contributing guidelines:**

* Update the `README` file with a bullet point refering to your dataset, following the same format including: title, brief explanation, download link, source link, file type.  

* If you have access to the raw dataset upload it to the repo inside a folder. The name of the folder should minimally describe the data inside. Consider adding a document briefly explaining the metrics along with the files if needed.  

* Use the source link on the `README` paragraph to credit the person who made the data available, or the original location where the dataset can be found. If this is your own dataset then credit yourself! The source link is important, so users know where to go to learn more about each specific dataset.  

Topics of interest include:

-- optical/sensor athlete tracking 
-- athlete monitoring data 
- physical profiling 
- Sport physiology data 
- injuries 
- schedule & travel metrics 
- sport biomechanics 
- video materials
- etc.
 
Companies that provide data through technology are also welcome to upload sample datasets as a way to help sport scientists become more familiar with the data. 

If not sure about how to make a contribution, here is a tutorial that explains how to contribute to a github project: [Link](https://github.com/MarcDiethelm/contributing/blob/master/README.md)

Thanks for your contribution!
